FIX:

Low prio: try to fix panel/sub-panel managers, only relevant when more screen are added!

TODO:

- Landscape button on workout panel
- Round progress bar

- Make workout setups with time, count and random
	- Add random button for both timed and counted

- Better visual for currently selected exercises
	- Could make a comma seperated list above/underneath the exercise list
	- Add x2,x3 .etc when selected more than once
	
- Add some fun animations
	- Make numbers pop when adding time
	- Flip screen when going to next screen
	- Make logo pulse at 3,2,1 ?

- Run in background (also put in settings?)

- Running exercise?
- Save/load workouts in json format
- Shared workouts
- Add some workout presets? (Spartan ed.)
- Add new workouts (Combine?)
- Configuration/settings screen for all variables
	- Remember settings etc. in playersettings
- Exercise count per round set (instead of global)
