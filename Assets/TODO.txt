FIX:

Low prio: try to fix panel/sub-panel managers, only relevant when more screen are added!

TODO:

- Make it possible to select no exercises for a workout
	- Prompt user to select number of round per set in a dialog
	- The "exercise" name displayed will just be "Work"

- Make workout setups with time, count and random
	- Two buttons on start with Timed / Counted?
	- Buttons with modes above the setup screen?
	- Add random button for both timed and counted
	- Counted has a global count at first

- Add a way to select multiple exercises for workout
- And also have a (better) visual for currently selected workouts
	- Could make a comma seperated list above/underneath the exercise list
	- Add x2,x3 .etc when selected more than once
	
- Add some fun animations
	- Make numbers pop when adding time
	- Flip screen when going to next screen
	- Make logo pulse at 3,2,1 ?
	
- Save/load workouts in json format
- Add new workouts (Combine?)
- Configurable work/rest times in setting screen
- Exercise count per round set individually (instead of global)
