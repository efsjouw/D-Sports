Low prio: try to fix panel/sub-panel managers, only relevant when more screen are added!

TODO:

- Add categories to exercises
- Improve random mode by using categories
- Have an overview of exercises you selected (in which order etc.)
- Search for exercises
- Make it possible to select exercises mutliple times (x1,2,3)

- Run in background (also put in settings?)

- Running exercise?
- Save/load workouts (in json format)
- Shared workouts
- Add some workout presets? (Spartan ed.)
- Add new workouts (Combine?)
- Configuration/settings screen for all variables
	- Remember settings etc. in playersettings
- Exercise count configurable for each round set (instead of global)
